The 2022 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge
Featuring KringleCon 5: Golden Rings!
Welcome to this year's SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! We can't wait for you to hop in the game and share some holiday cheer as you build vital cybersecurity skills.

Before you start, we have two urgent messages for you. First, a really big snow storm has struck the North Pole, piling up snow all around Santa's castle and even blocking the doors. To continue their holiday prep, the elves have burrowed into the snow uncovering many fascinating things below the surface. Second, Santa's Five Golden Rings are missing! These Rings have magical powers vital to Santa's holiday operation. We absolutely need your help in finding the Rings, so get ready to embark on five epic quests. Remember to click on the badge in the center of your avatar to track your progress.

And, one last thing -- As you engage with our North Pole team and other players, remember to always treat them with kindness and respect following the Holiday Hack Challenge [Code of Conduct and Terms of Use](https://2022.kringlecon.com/invite?modal=tos).

Once you've read that code and agree to it, feel free to sign in.

Happy Holidays from the entire SANS Holiday Hack Challenge team!

made file ~/nmap-bootstrap.xsl from:
[https://j1v37u2k3y.github.io/assets/reports/nmap/nmap-bootstrap.xsl](https://j1v37u2k3y.github.io/assets/reports/nmap/nmap-bootstrap.xsl)

#### Get All Hosts

```shell
#!/bin/bash
IP="172.18.0.0/24"
working_dir="${HOME}/nmap/${IP}"
rm -rf "${working_dir}"
mkdir -p "${working_dir}"
nmap -n -vvv -p- -oA "${working_dir}"/version --stylesheet ~/nmap-bootstrap.xsl "${IP}"
```

#### Scan to refine results

```shell
#!/bin/bash
IP="172.18.0.0/24"
working_dir="${HOME}/nmap/${IP}"
cat $working_dir/version.gnmap | grep open | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 2 > "${working_dir}/hosts"
new_working_dir="${HOME}/nmap/${IP}/refined"
rm -rf "${new_working_dir}"
mkdir -p "${new_working_dir}"
nmap -n -vvv -p- -oA "${new_working_dir}"/multiple --stylesheet ~/nmap-bootstrap.xsl -iL "${working_dir}/hosts"
```

##### Yields 5 hosts
